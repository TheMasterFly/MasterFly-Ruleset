Behold mine mod. Archers are weaker, swordsmen might have a place now and civ balance has been kicked out of the house, despite my best efforts to rehabilitate it. Here's a list of the standouts, and please note the bigget changes are in this top list:

**Biggest Changes:**
1) Workers can now improve water tile, while Work Boats have lost that ability. Instead, they can 'fish' by ending their turn on a Fishing Boats improvement/improved water resource tile. Once this has been done three times, they acquire the 'Fish Harvest' promotion, where they must return to a city and can consume themselves to give a large food buff to the city.

'BUG' NOTE: When your Work Boat ends its turn in a city, it will lose all progress of fishing unless it has completed fishing (so you can stockpile harvests). Since Work Boats need to be in the city when created to gain the required promotion, if it is created outside and doesn't have the promotion, you can end its turn in a city to regain it.

2) Your very first Settler now ignores terrain costs and has 4 movement, to encourage flexibility in starts.

3) Archers are nerfed, infantry is buffed and cavalry are... adjusted. If you know AOE2's system of units, then that is what I am basing it off of.

4) New City-States added! These are:
Horse & Iron-providing City States (Gold secondary yield),
Oil-Provider City States (Gold secondary yield)

5) Rationalim is nerfed, Liberty, Commerce and Piety is (over?) buffed. Exploration has been added.

If you have any questions, I am in the Unciv Discord as 'MasterFly'. I'd especially love to hear feedback on civ balance :trollface:

**Added Civs:**
Almoravids, Armenia, Crusader States, Dai Viet, Georgia, Kilwa Sultanate, Lithuania, Norway, Papal States, Portugal, Timurids

There are few civs I have yet to adjust, but most have been changed.

Finally, this mod is very compatible with the More Luxuries mod. I'd like to add my own sprites eventually, but until then I use that add-on in conjunction with this one.
